"""
Python is an object oriented programming language.


Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
"""

#Class should be written in PascalCase
#There are three members in the class
#1.Properties
#2.Constructor
#3.Method

#Property 

t=20
class MyName():

    x=4
# objectName= ClassName()
dan = MyName()# where Dan is an object

#How we can access the members
#Dot. is member selection operator 

#object.member

print(dan.x*t)

print(f"The product of x and t is {(dan.x*t)}")




#Constructor is a member  of class and actually it is a function
